## Conclusion
Not the most well-written and/or basic tutorial.  Going to look for a different one and come back this maybe.

<strong>Update:</strong> After running into myriad errors I -- quickly, thankfully -- ran across a [post](https://medium.com/p/20b4ad07e8f0/responses/show) warning me off this tutorial.  Abandoned.
